## ⚠️ SYSTEMS REQUIRING TESTING

### 1. Email Delivery System
**Status:** ⚠️ CONFIGURED BUT UNTESTED

**Edge Functions:**
- `send-lead-email`: No logs = never called OR not working
- `secure-lead-submission`: No logs = never called OR not working

**RESEND_API_KEY Status:** ✅ Configured in Supabase

**What Should Happen:**
1. User submits lead form
2. `secure-lead-submission` validates + stores in DB
3. `send-lead-email` sends TWO emails:
   - **Notification** → info@tradeline247ai.com
   - **Confirmation** → Lead's email address

**Test Required:**
1. Submit lead form on homepage
2. Check both inboxes for emails
3. Monitor edge function logs

**Potential Issues:**
- FROM_EMAIL not configured in edge function secrets
- RESEND domain not verified at resend.com
- Edge function not being called due to client-side issue

### 2. Support Ticket System
**Status:** ⚠️ UNUSED

**Database:** ✅ Table exists with RLS policies
**Forms:** ❌ No UI form found in codebase
**Edge Functions:** ❌ No dedicated function

**Database Capacity:**
- Rate limiting table active
- Policies allow anonymous + authenticated submissions
- Admin-only viewing

### 3. Appointment System
**Status:** ⚠️ READY BUT UNUSED

**Database:** ✅ Advanced security with PII masking
**Forms:** ❌ No public booking form found
**Functions:** ✅ `get_secure_appointment()` implemented

**Security Features:**
- PII fields encrypted/masked
- RLS policies prevent direct access
- Secure functions for admin viewing only
- Audit logging on all access

### 4. Twilio Voice Integration
**Status:** ⚠️ DEPLOYED BUT UNVERIFIED

**Edge Functions:**
- `voice-answer`: No logs (never called)
- `voice-status`: No logs (never called)

**Database Tables:**
- `call_lifecycle`: Ready
- `hotline_call_sessions`: Ready with consent tracking
- `hotline_rate_limit_ani`: Rate limiting configured

**Test Required:**
1. Call +1-587-742-8885 (if active)
2. Verify consent banner plays
3. Check call forwarding to +1-431-990-0222
4. Monitor `call_lifecycle` table for records

**Webhook Configuration Needed:**
- Voice URL: `https://hysvqdwmhxnblxfqnszn.supabase.co/functions/v1/voice-answer`
- Status Callback: `https://hysvqdwmhxnblxfqnszn.supabase.co/functions/v1/voice-status`

### 5. RAG (Knowledge Base) System
**Status:** ⚠️ DEPLOYED BUT UNUSED

**Edge Functions:**
- `rag-search`: No logs
- `rag-answer`: No logs
- `rag-ingest`: No logs
- `ragz`: Health check endpoint

**Database:**
