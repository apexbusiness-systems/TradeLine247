## Error-Free Console Verification

### Check All Edge Function Logs
```bash
# voice-answer logs (last 50 entries)
supabase functions logs voice-answer --limit 50

# Look for:
# ✅ No [ERROR] entries
# ✅ All webhook calls logged with 200 OK
# ✅ No exceptions or stack traces
```

### Database Integrity Check
```sql
-- Verify all calls logged correctly
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_test_calls,
  COUNT(DISTINCT call_sid) AS unique_calls,
  SUM(CASE WHEN recording_consent THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS consented_calls
FROM call_lifecycle
WHERE created_at > now() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Expected: total_test_calls = 7 (one per test)
```
