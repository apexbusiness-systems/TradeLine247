## Next Steps (When US Expansion is Approved)

1. Review business requirements and choose compliance path
2. Assign compliance owner
3. Complete registration (allow 1-2 weeks)
4. Test with compliant number in staging
5. Update `sms-status` and `sms-inbound` functions to handle US-specific error codes
6. Enable production traffic
7. Monitor throughput and filtering for first 48 hours

**REMINDER:** This checklist must be completed BEFORE sending any SMS from US local or toll-free numbers. Failure to comply will result in carrier filtering and message blocks.
