## 1. Data Security & Encryption

### 1.1 Encryption Algorithm
- [ ] **AES-256-GCM** encryption standard implemented
- [ ] Initialization Vector (IV) unique per record
- [ ] IV stored alongside encrypted data in `pii_iv` column
- [ ] Key length: 256-bit minimum
- [ ] Encryption library: pgcrypto (PostgreSQL native) or equivalent

**Verification Command:**
```sql
SELECT
  LENGTH(pii_iv) > 0 as iv_present,
  LENGTH(email_encrypted) > 0 as data_encrypted
FROM public.appointments
WHERE email_encrypted IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;
```

**Status:** [ ] ✅ Verified  [ ] ⚠️ Needs Review  [ ] ❌ Not Implemented
**Notes:** _________________________________

---

### 1.2 Key Management
- [ ] Encryption key stored securely (not in code)
- [ ] Key accessible only via `get_app_encryption_key()` accessor
- [ ] Accessor function uses `SECURITY DEFINER` (elevated privileges)
- [ ] Only `service_role` can execute accessor
- [ ] Key storage location documented (app_config table)
- [ ] Key backup stored in secure offline location
- [ ] Key rotation procedure documented

**Current Key Storage:** `public.app_config` table (RLS enforced)
**Future Migration Path:** Supabase Vault (documented in ENCRYPTION_VAULT_MIGRATION.md)

**Verification Command:**
```sql
-- Verify accessor exists and is properly secured
SELECT
  routine_name,
  security_type,
  specific_name
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name = 'get_app_encryption_key';

-- Verify RLS on app_config
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename = 'app_config';
```

**Status:** [ ] ✅ Verified  [ ] ⚠️ Needs Review  [ ] ❌ Not Implemented
**Notes:** _________________________________

---

### 1.3 Plaintext Retention (Rollback Safety)
- [ ] Original plaintext columns retained (`email`, `e164`, `first_name`)
- [ ] Plaintext columns still functional for backward compatibility
- [ ] Encrypted columns added separately (`email_encrypted`, etc.)
- [ ] Migration does NOT delete plaintext during encryption
- [ ] Plaintext deprecation plan documented (future phase)

**Rationale:** Allows safe rollback if decryption fails

**Status:** [ ] ✅ Verified  [ ] ⚠️ Needs Review  [ ] ❌ Not Implemented
**Notes:** _________________________________

---

## 2. Access Control & Authorization

### 2.1 Row-Level Security (RLS)
- [ ] RLS enabled on `appointments` table
- [ ] RLS policies enforce organization membership checks
- [ ] Service role has elevated access for encryption operations
- [ ] Regular users CANNOT access raw table (must use safe views)
- [ ] `appointments_safe` view returns masked data only

**Verification Command:**
```sql
-- Check RLS enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename = 'appointments';

-- List RLS policies
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  cmd,
  qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'appointments';
```

**Status:** [ ] ✅ Verified  [ ] ⚠️ Needs Review  [ ] ❌ Not Implemented
**Notes:** _________________________________

---

### 2.2 Function Security
- [ ] All encryption functions use `SECURITY DEFINER`
- [ ] Functions set `search_path = public` to prevent injection
- [ ] Only `service_role` can execute encryption functions
- [ ] PUBLIC, authenticated, anon roles REVOKED from sensitive functions
- [ ] Permissions matrix documented

**Functions to Verify:**
1. `get_app_encryption_key()`
2. `encrypt_pii_with_iv()`
3. `decrypt_pii_with_iv_logged()`
4. `batch_encrypt_appointments()`
5. `get_encryption_health_summary()`

**Verification Command:**
```sql
SELECT
  routine_name,
  routine_type,
  security_type,
  specific_name
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name IN (
  'get_app_encryption_key',
  'encrypt_pii_with_iv',
  'decrypt_pii_with_iv_logged',
  'batch_encrypt_appointments'
);
```

**Status:** [ ] ✅ Verified  [ ] ⚠️ Needs Review  [ ] ❌ Not Implemented
**Notes:** _________________________________

---

### 2.3 Admin Role Verification
- [ ] Admin role checks use `has_role()` function
- [ ] Admin role stored in separate `user_roles` table
- [ ] Role checks never use client-side data (no localStorage)
- [ ] Security monitoring dashboard restricted to admins only

**Verification Command:**
```sql
-- Check has_role function exists
SELECT routine_name, security_type
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name = 'has_role';

-- Verify user_roles table RLS
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename = 'user_roles';
```

**Status:** [ ] ✅ Verified  [ ] ⚠️ Needs Review  [ ] ❌ Not Implemented
**Notes:** _________________________________

---

## 3. Monitoring & Audit Trails

### 3.1 Audit Logging
- [ ] All key access logged in `encryption_key_audit` table
- [ ] All decryption errors logged in `encryption_errors` table
- [ ] Audit logs include timestamp, role, success/failure
- [ ] Audit logs DO NOT contain plaintext secrets
- [ ] Audit logs retained for minimum 90 days
- [ ] Audit logs accessible only to admins

**Verification Command:**
```sql
-- Check audit tables exist with RLS
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('encryption_key_audit', 'encryption_errors');

-- Sample audit entries
SELECT
  access_type,
  accessed_by_role,
  success,
  access_timestamp
FROM public.encryption_key_audit
ORDER BY access_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Status:** [ ] ✅ Verified  [ ] ⚠️ Needs Review  [ ] ❌ Not Implemented
**Notes:** _________________________________

---

### 3.2 Health Monitoring
- [ ] `get_encryption_health_summary()` function created

```sql
SELECT * FROM public.get_encryption_health_summary();
```

**Expected Output:**
