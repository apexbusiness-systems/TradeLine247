## 📞 Hot-Reload Development

For testing during development, the app is configured to connect to your
Lovable preview URL with hot-reload enabled:

```typescript
server: {
  url: 'https://555a4971-4138-435e-a7ee-dfa3d713d1d3.lovableproject.com?forceHideBadge=true',
  cleartext: true
}
```

**To disable hot-reload for production builds:**
1. Remove the `server` section from `capacitor.config.ts`
2. Rebuild: `npm run build && npx cap sync`
