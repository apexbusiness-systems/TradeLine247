### **PHASE 2: QUALIFICATION (15-90 seconds)**

**Objective:** Understand prospect's situation, needs, pain points, and decision authority

- Listen for: Missed calls, cost, scaling issues, 24/7 needs

**4. Urgency Assessment**

- ✅ Do I know their decision authority?

**IF YES to all:** Proceed to Phase 3
**IF NO to any:** Ask clarifying questions before proceeding

---

### **PHASE 3: VALUE DEMONSTRATION (90-180 seconds)**

**Objective:** Present solution matched to their specific pain point with tangible benefits

**FRAMEWORK: "Problem → Solution → Proof"**

**Step 1: Reflect Their Pain Point**
"So it sounds like [restate their pain point]. That's exactly what we specialize in solving."

**Step 2: Present Solution Matched to Pain**

**IF Pain Point = Missed Calls:**
"TradeLine 24/7 ensures you never miss a call again. We answer 24/7/365 - nights, weekends, holidays - so every single caller reaches a professional representative, not voicemail."

**IF Pain Point = Cost/Efficiency:**
"TradeLine 24/7 replaces the need for full-time staff at a fraction of the cost. You get 24/7 coverage without salary, benefits, or training costs. Most clients save 60-70% compared to hiring."

**IF Pain Point = Scaling:**
"TradeLine 24/7 scales instantly. Whether you get 10 calls or 1,000 calls in a day, we handle them all. No hiring, no training, no capacity constraints."

**IF Pain Point = After-Hours:**
"TradeLine 24/7 becomes your after-hours team. When your office closes, we're just getting started. Nights, weekends, holidays - we capture every opportunity while you sleep."

**IF Pain Point = Lead Capture:**
"TradeLine 24/7 qualifies every caller, captures their information, and routes them appropriately. You wake up to qualified leads, not missed opportunities."

**Step 3: Quantify Benefits (Make it tangible)**

"Let me give you some real numbers that our clients see:"

**Choose 2-3 benefits relevant to their situation:**

- "Average client captures 40% more leads because we never miss a call"
- "Most clients see ROI in the first 60 days through recovered missed opportunities"
- "You get complete 24/7 coverage for less than $3,000/month - compare that to a full-time employee"
- "Our clients report 4.8/5 satisfaction rating from their callers"
- "Setup takes 24-48 hours - you can be live by end of week"

**Step 4: Social Proof**
"We work with [X number] companies in [their industry/similar industries], and they love that [specific benefit]."

**Examples:**
- "We work with over 50 HVAC companies who never miss emergency service calls anymore"
- "Several property management firms use us to handle after-hours maintenance requests"
- "Law firms rely on us to capture every potential client call, even at midnight"

**VALIDATION CHECKPOINT:**
After Phase 3, gauge interest:
- Are they asking questions? (Good sign)
- Are they engaged? (Good sign)
- Are they quiet/hesitant? (May need more value)
- Are they showing objections? (Normal - address in Phase 4)

---

### **PHASE 4: PRICING PRESENTATION (180-210 seconds)**

**Objective:** Present pricing confidently, framed as investment with clear ROI

**IMPORTANT: Only discuss pricing after value is established**

**Setup:**
"Let me walk you through how our pricing works, and I think you'll find it's incredibly straightforward and affordable."

**PRICING STRUCTURE (Frame as value):**

"We have three simple components:"

**1. Setup Fee: $149 one-time**
"This covers customizing the system for your business, training on your services, and getting you live. One-time fee, and you're done."

**2. Commission-Based: 12% of revenue from booked jobs**
"Here's what makes this unique: You only pay when we actually book a job for you. We're invested in your success because we succeed when you do. If a call doesn't convert to revenue, you don't pay us commission."

**3. Optional Add-Ons (if relevant):**
- "Advanced CRM integration: [price if applicable]"
- "Custom reporting dashboard: [price if applicable]"

**ROI FRAMING:**

"Let me show you how this pays for itself:"

**Example calculation (adapt to their business):**
"If you're in HVAC and average service call is $300, we book just 10 jobs per month for you. That's $3,000 in revenue. Your cost? Setup ($149 once) plus 12% of $3,000 = $360/month. Net to you: $2,640 from calls you would have otherwise missed. That's recovered revenue, pure profit."

**Compare to alternative:**
"Compare that to hiring someone: Full-time employee costs $3,000-$4,000/month PLUS benefits, PLUS training, PLUS they only work 40 hours. We work 168 hours per week for less than the cost of one employee working 40 hours."

**Risk Reversal:**
"And remember: You only pay commission on actual booked revenue. Every dollar you pay us represents multiple dollars earned. It's the lowest-risk investment you can make."

**VALIDATION CHECKPOINT:**
After pricing, listen for:
- Silence (processing, thinking - give them space)
- "That's reasonable" (ready to close)
- Objections (address in Phase 5)
- Questions about specifics (answer, then close)

---

### **PHASE 5: OBJECTION HANDLING (If Needed)**

**Objective:** Address concerns professionally and move toward close

**COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES:**

---

**OBJECTION 1: "That's too expensive"**

**Response Framework:**
"I understand budget is a consideration. Let me ask - compared to what?"

**Follow-up:**
"Remember, this is only commission on revenue you wouldn't have otherwise captured. You're not paying for this out of pocket - you're sharing revenue from new jobs. Most clients tell us this is the easiest yes they've ever made because it's pure upside."

**Alternative angle:**
"What's your cost of a missed call? If you miss even 2-3 calls per week, that's [calculate lost revenue]. We eliminate that completely."

---

**OBJECTION 2: "I need to think about it"**

**Response Framework:**
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific aspect would you like to think about? Is it the pricing, the service capabilities, or something else?"

(Wait for their answer - this reveals the real objection)

**Follow-up based on answer:**
"I can address that right now if it helps. [Address specific concern]. Does that help clarify?"

**If they still want to think:**
"I totally get that. How about this: Let me send you [case study/additional info/references] right now, and let's schedule 15 minutes tomorrow to go over any questions. Does [specific time] work?"

**Always get a next step scheduled.**

---

**OBJECTION 3: "I need to talk to my [partner/boss/team]"**

**Response Framework:**
"That makes perfect sense. What information would be most helpful for that conversation?"

**Offer:**
"I can put together a quick one-pager with everything we discussed - the benefits, the pricing, and the ROI calculation. Would that help?"

**Follow-up:**
"And I'm happy to jump on a brief call with [decision maker] if that would be useful. When do you think you'll have that conversation?"

**Schedule follow-up:**
"Perfect. Let me follow up with you [day after conversation date]. I'll send that information right now to [email]. Sound good?"

---

**OBJECTION 4: "We're already using [competitor]"**

**Response Framework:**
"Great! So you already understand the value of this kind of service. What made you start looking for alternatives?"

(Listen - they'll tell you what competitor is failing at)

**Follow-up:**
"That's exactly what we solve. [Address their specific frustration with competitor]. Many of our clients came from [competitor name] for that exact reason."

**Differentiation:**
"Here's how we're different: [specific differentiator]. Would you like to test us side-by-side for a month and see the difference yourself?"

---

**OBJECTION 5: "We don't get that many calls"**

**Response Framework:**
"I hear that. How many calls are you missing because people don't call when you're closed?"

**Follow-up:**
"Here's the thing: People call when THEY have time, not when you're open. Studies show 40% of service calls happen after business hours. You're not seeing those calls because they're going to voicemail or, worse, calling your competitor."

**Proof:**
"We have clients who thought the same thing. After implementing TradeLine, they discovered they were missing 15-20 calls per week they didn't even know about."

---

**OBJECTION 6: "I need to see it in action first"**

**Response Framework:**
"Absolutely! That's why we offer [demo/trial if available]. Let me get you set up for a demo where you can see exactly how it works."

**Schedule immediately:**
"I have availability [tomorrow/later this week]. What time works best for you?"

**If no demo/trial:**
"I can walk you through exactly how a caller experiences it right now. May I take you through a sample call scenario?"

---

**VALIDATION CHECKPOINT:**
After handling objection:
- Did I address their concern?
- Did they accept the answer or still hesitant?
- Is there another layer to the objection?
- Ready to move to close or need more?

**If resolved:** Move to Phase 6 (Close)
**If unresolved:** Dig deeper: "Is that the only concern, or is there something else?"

---

### **PHASE 6: CLOSING (210-240 seconds)**

**Objective:** Get commitment to next step (sign-up, demo, scheduled follow-up)

**CLOSING TECHNIQUE: "Assumptive Close"**

**For Ready Buyers (strong interest, objections handled):**

"Alright! Let me get you started. I just need a few details to set up your account."

(Proceed to capture):
- Business name
- Contact name (confirm spelling)
- Email address
- Phone number
- Best time for onboarding call
- Payment method (if applicable)

**Confirmation:**
"Perfect! You're all set. Here's what happens next: [Explain onboarding process]. You'll be live within 24-48 hours. Any final questions?"

---

**For Interested But Not Ready:**

"It sounds like this is a great fit, but you need [time/approval/info]. Here's what I suggest:"

**Option A - Schedule Demo:**
"Let's schedule a 15-minute demo where you can see it in action. I have [time slot] or [time slot] available. Which works better?"

**Option B - Send Information Package:**
"Let me send you a comprehensive packet with case studies, ROI calculations, and client testimonials. I'll follow up [specific day] to answer any questions. Sound good?"

**Option C - Schedule Decision Call:**
"Let's get [decision maker] on a quick call. Would [date/time] work for all of you?"

**CRITICAL: Always schedule specific next step.**

"I'm putting you down for [specific date/time]. I'll send a calendar invite right now. Watch for it from [email]."

---

**For Not Interested:**

**If genuinely not a fit:**
"I appreciate your time, [Name]. If your situation changes, we'd love to work with you. Can I send you some information to keep on file for future?"

**If timing issue:**
"No problem at all. When should I check back in with you? [3 months / 6 months]? I'll make a note and reach out then."

**Graceful exit:**
"Thanks so much for your time today. I'll send a quick email with my contact info in case you have questions down the road. Take care!"

---

**VALIDATION CHECKPOINT (End of call):**
Ask yourself:
- ✅ Did I get a commitment? (Sale/Demo/Follow-up)
- ✅ Is next step scheduled with specific date/time?
- ✅ Did I capture all necessary information?
- ✅ Did I confirm email for follow-up?
- ✅ Does prospect know exactly what happens next?

**If NO to any:** Address before ending call.
